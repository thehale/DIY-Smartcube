  abstract  = {3D motion tracking is one key technology in computer animation, virtual reality, natural
user interface, and so on. Over the last thirty years numerous projects with various
approaches have developed motion tracking systems, including mechanical, ultrasonic,
magnetic, and optical schemes. Recently, interest has also been growing in the motion
tracking of small targets in complex environments and tracking subtle movements. For
example, the behavior analysis of insects or other small creatures in the earth will
contribute to the growth of biology or related sciences, and the precise analysis
of dexterous finger motions will be useful for professional techniques or the skills
required for traditional handcrafts or medical procedures. Unfortunately, common existing
tracking systems cannot satisfy the requirements of these tasks because the targets
are too small and their motions are complex and easily occluded.},

  abstract       = {A novel, chipless, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) sensor is proposed for monitoring angular rotation. The rotation state is recovered by collecting the cross polar response of a tag, based on a periodic surface composed of a set of dipoles. The encoding mechanism allows the sensor to be very robust, even if it is applied on metallic objects, or in an environment with strong multipath. The proposed sensor does not require a large operational bandwidth. Instead, only a small set of reading frequencies are required. The number of reading frequencies required is dependent on the number of the employed dipoles. It is demonstrated that the rotation state of an object can be monitored within a span of 180 degrees, with up to a three-degree resolution, by employing a chipless RFID sensor comprising of four dipoles. The far field reading scheme and the absence of any electronics device allow the sensor to be employed in harsh environments.},
